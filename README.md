# DECAMP-2-Project
# DECAMP2 Database Interface

Our goal in this project was to create a user-friendly web interface enabling researchers and students to easily access and analyze the DECAMP2 study data. Our objectives included developing an intuitive interface, setting up a database, and offering data visualization features.

## Project Details

Our main tasks involved:

1. **Database implementation**: Cleaning up the provided data tables and integrating them into a MariaDB database.
2. **User interface development**: Developing a Python Dash-based interface to allow for interactive data visualizations.
3. **Data query functionalities**: Implementing different query methods for the database via the user interface to assist researchers.
4. **Data download feature**: Enabling data to be downloaded to local drives in multiple formats.
5. **External RNA-seq database linkage**: Linking to the external Gene Expression Omnibus RNA-seq database.
6. **Study overview**: Providing a comprehensive overview of the study.
7. **Help pages**: Creating help pages for user support.

These tasks were successfully achieved and implemented in a user-friendly web interface, currently accessible at https://bioed.bu.edu/students_23/Team_G/index.html. 

## Challenges and Solutions

We faced a few challenges during the project:

- We couldn't use the Dash framework due to the limitations of its free version. We instead used Google Charts and Python CGI module to create the web interface.
- We initially planned to restrict access to specific "bu" email addresses. However, we realized that the interface and the database would be uploaded to the labâ€™s server, and thus, will already be restricted.
- Debugging the Python code was difficult as errors didn't show up on the Bioed error log.
